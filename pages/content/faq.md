## When is the program running next / how can I apply?

For this and related questions, see our [informational site](https://www.arena.education/), which contains more information about the program, when we're opening applications, who is on our team, and more.

## Does this page replace the Streamlit page?

The Streamlit page will still exist, and it will contain exactly the same material. Both the Streamlit page and this website display material from the same [GitHub repo](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0), which we have no plans to change.

The purpose of this page is to provide a more user-friendly way to browse the material, with more polished extra features like an improved chatbot, ability to download exercise context, etc. We created this page because the content was growing very large, and Streamlit no longer provided the flexibility we wanted to create the ideal studying experience.

## How to study this material?

You can study this material in the exact same way as before. There are 3 options:

- **Use Colabs** - each chapter section will provide a link to an "exercise Colab" (for filling in the answers to questions) and a "solutions Colab" (where you can compare your solutions to the ones we've provided).
- **Use VSCode (or your own IDE), working from empty Python files** - you can read through the material on this website, and copy in blocks of code to the notebook or Python file you're working with. This will require cloning the ARENA_3.0 repo (and we also recommend using a remote machine for some of the more compute-intensive exercise days).
- **Use VSCode (or your own IDE), working from the exercise notebooks** - this is essentially a hybrid of the first 2 approaches: you can work on your preferred IDE, but complete the exercises by working through `.ipynb` exercise files which are equivalent to the "exercise Colab" notebooks mentioned above. Again, this will require cloning the ARENA_3.0 repo (and we recommend using a remote machine). Each exercise notebook can be found in a path like `chapter1_transformer_interp/exercises/part1_transformer_from_scratch/1.1_Transformer_from_Scratch_exercises.ipynb`

For detailed setup instructions (including how to set up a virtual machine), see the [Setup Instructions](/setup/) page.
